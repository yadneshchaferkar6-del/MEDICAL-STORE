🏥 Medical Store Management System
A web-based Medical Store Management System built using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and SQLite as a college project. It allows users to browse medicines, add them to a cart, and manage purchases through a simple and clean interface.
📌 About the Project
This project simulates a basic online medical store where:

Users can log in to their account
Browse available medicines/products
Add items to a shopping cart
View and manage their cart before checkout

It was developed as a college mini-project to demonstrate the integration of a Python web framework (Flask) with a front-end interface and a lightweight database (SQLite).
