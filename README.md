## 📌 About the Project

This project simulates a basic online medical store where:
- Users can **log in** to their account
- Browse available **medicines/products**
- Add items to a **shopping cart**
- View and manage their cart before checkout

It was developed as a college mini-project to demonstrate the integration of a Python web framework (Flask) with a front-end interface and a lightweight database (SQLite).
